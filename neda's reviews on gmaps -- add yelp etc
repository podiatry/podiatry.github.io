This clinic is very clean and well organized. Dr Khoobyar is very knowledgeable and very understanding. 


I first hobbled into the office of Dr. Needa Khoobyar with an extremely painful, lingering though still undiagnosed foot condition back in November 2019. After a brief though careful examination she gave a provisional diagnosis, one which was confirmed by subsequent XRays she ordered.This condition caused by an underlying medical condition and if left untreated would have for me, serious and life changing consequences indeed. Her incremental treatment strategy owed much to both modern day science and age old common sense, a rarity in today's world of treating the symptom instead of the source. Thank You Dr. Khoobyar, because of your proactive measures I have now regained the use of my left foot.  To refer to Dr. Khoobyar as a Podiatrist  is somewhat akin to saying Sinatra was a singer, Picaso a painter or referring to Ali as someone who once boxed for a living. They were all of course so much more and Dr. Khoobyar is also much more than a Podiatrist. She is doctor, psychologist, care giver, listener, humorist and psychiatrist all rolled into one and goes about her work with what seems to me , untypical irreverence, for any doctor.  Therefore, I say to anyone ,without fear of contradiction that your feet will be always be  in the best hands with Dr. Khoobyar because  she is simply the best. I hope she continues in practice for forever and a day.
